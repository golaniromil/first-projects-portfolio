Welcome to my first projects portfolio! This repository showcases my learning journey in data analytics, data science and visualization using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python,AI,ML and other tools. Each project includes datasets, dashboards, and insights.

# Hotel Booking Dashboard 📊

## Project Overview
This project is an **interactive hotel booking dashboard** that provides insights into booking trends, cancellation rates, and customer behavior. The dataset includes details on different hotel types, customer categories, and cancellations, helping businesses optimize their booking strategies and minimize revenue loss.

## Key Insights 🔍
1. **High Cancellation Rate in City Hotels** – City hotels experience significantly higher cancellations (over 6,000 bookings canceled) compared to resort hotels.
2. **Couples Are the Largest Customer Segment** – Couples account for the majority of bookings (~16,000 guests), but they also have the highest cancellation rate.
3. **Families and Single Travelers Have Lower Bookings** – These groups contribute fewer bookings but have lower cancellation rates.
4. **Revenue Loss Due to Cancellations** – A high number of cancellations impact revenue and business stability.
5. **Potential Seasonal Trends** – While the dataset does not explicitly include seasonal data, trends can be analyzed to identify peak booking and cancellation periods.

## Business Recommendations 💡
To improve booking stability and revenue growth, the following strategies can be implemented:

### 1️⃣ **Reduce Cancellations in City Hotels**
✔ Implement stricter cancellation policies (e.g., non-refundable discounts).  
✔ Send reminders and special offers to retain customers before cancellation.

### 2️⃣ **Increase Family & Solo Traveler Bookings**
✔ Offer family-friendly packages and discounts.  
✔ Provide solo traveler incentives (e.g., free breakfast, flexible check-in).

### 3️⃣ **Enhance Revenue Predictability**
✔ Introduce a loyalty program to encourage repeat bookings.  
✔ Use predictive analytics to forecast cancellations and adjust pricing dynamically.

### 4️⃣ **Optimize Marketing Strategies**
✔ Identify peak booking seasons and run targeted promotions.  
✔ Utilize online reviews and social media to attract reliable customers.

## Future Improvements 🚀
🔹 **Trend Analysis Charts** – Visualize how bookings and cancellations change over time.  
🔹 **Revenue Metrics** – Show financial impact due to cancellations.  
🔹 **Customer Retention Metrics** – Measure repeat guest bookings.  
🔹 **Competitor Benchmarking** – Compare cancellation rates with industry standards.

## Conclusion 📈
This dashboard provides valuable insights that can help hotel businesses reduce cancellations, increase customer engagement, and optimize revenue. By implementing strategic changes based on these insights, hotels can improve their booking efficiency and overall profitability.
